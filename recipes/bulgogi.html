        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Bulgogi, or Korean barbecued beef, is made with marinated sliced beef. 
            Most recipes call for crushed pear to tenderize the meat. 
            My boyfriend's Korean mother says Coca-Cola can also be used for the same purpose. 
            This recipe uses very thinly-sliced sirloin steak, so tenderization isn't necessary. It's delicious served with rice, lettuce leaves, and chile paste or kimchi.</p>
            

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
